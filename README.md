# 🌍 Hybrid Language Detection System (Machine Learning)

This project is a **Hybrid Language Detection System** that predicts the language of a given sentence using a combination of **rule-based script detection** and **machine learning** techniques.

The model supports **multiple international and Indian languages** and works interactively from the terminal.

## 🧠 Key Idea

Instead of relying only on machine learning, this project uses a **hybrid approach**:

1. **Script Detection (Rule-based)**  
   Detects the writing system of the input text using Unicode ranges  
   (Latin, Devanagari, Tamil, Telugu, Urdu).

2. **Machine Learning Prediction**  
   Uses **TF-IDF character n-grams** with a **Naive Bayes classifier** to predict the exact language.

This approach improves accuracy and handles multilingual inputs more effectively.
